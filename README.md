This website is built entirely with Ruby on Rails. It utilizes the B-Crypt gem for Auth.

This website is a game where you watch cute snails race towards a food item and bet on which one will win.

## Features:
1. Create any number of custom snails by choosing from a selection of shell and body colors. Choose their favorite food and give them a unique name to make them stand out.
2. Enter the snails into open races or create a new race. Races always have four slots for racers. once a race has four registered racers, you can watch the race.
3. Place bets before the race begins. If your snail wins, you'll get all the prize money and you can view your betting hisory and total winnings on your profile page.
4. The racing animation is done using CSS and uses inline styles to randomize the results.
